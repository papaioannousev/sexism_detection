# Sexism detection on a large collection of tweets

## Dataset

We employed a Kaggle dataset with title "Cyberbulling Dataset". This dataset contains a large collection of annotated datasets suitable for automated cyberbullying detection. The enclosed data come from different platforms (Twitter, Youtube, Kaggle, Wikipedia Talks) and are organized into smaller subsets focusing on different aspects of cyberbulling such as aggression, attack, toxicity, racism, and sexism. For our project, we utilized the subcollection of data realted to sexism. More specifically, it is composed of 14881 tweets, annotated as either sexist or non sexist.
